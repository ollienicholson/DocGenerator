#   title page
#   text - calulated and static
#   graphs - bar, scatter, pie, and heat map
#   data will be pulled from a database


# USER
# user will render reports
# user should be able to customise the templates
# user should be able to enter specifc values required before rendering a doc

the user should be able to specify the font type of the header and the body text

the user should be able to specify to font size of the header and the body of the text

user should be able to add hero image

user should be able to select their NRL team from which team specific data will render


# this tool will first be built as a gui
# then we will move this tool to a web-based tool
# web-based tool will be user-auth and may not be written in Python, maybe TS?

# # TODO

** add graphs for both players and games

** create GUI version
firstly just try to get the GUI to render a report, the test.docx by pressing a button "get report"

** allow for reports to be rendered based on team and player selection
then split it up in to two tabs: one for players, one for teams
then make two drop down menus:
