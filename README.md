PROJECT
# in this project we want to create a tool which allows you to render a docx report


REPORT
# this report will have: 
#   title page
#   text - calulated and static
#   graphs - bar, scatter, pie, (and heat map?)
#   data will be pulled from a database


# USER
# user will render reports
# user should be able to customise the templates
# user should be able to enter specifc values required before rendering a doc
# the user should be able to specify the font type of the header and the body text
# the user should be able to specify to font size of the header and the body of the text
# user should be able to add hero image
# user should be able to select their NRL team from which team specific data will render


# this tool will first be built as a gui
# then we will move this tool to a web-based tool
# web-based tool will be user-auth and may not be written in Python, maybe TS?
