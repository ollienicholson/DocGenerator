# Automatic Report Generation Tool

## Project Overview

This project is an automatic report generation tool designed to streamline the process of creating detailed, customized reports. The tool leverages data pulled from public APIs and allows users to customize various aspects of the report, including text, visualizations, and formatting.

1. **Title Page**
2. **Text**: Both calculated and static text generated by ChatGPT (Work in Progress)
3. **Visualizations**
4. **Data**: Pulled from a public API

## User Features

- Enter specific values required before rendering a document
- Specify the font type for the header and body text
- Specify the font size for the header and body text
- Add a hero image

## Roadmap

1. **GUI Development**: Initial tool development as a GUI.
2. **Web-Based Tool**: Transition to a web-based tool.
   - Web-based tool will include user authentication.
   - Potential use of TypeScript instead of Python.
3. **Future Data Scraping**: Implement data scraping from source for future updates.
